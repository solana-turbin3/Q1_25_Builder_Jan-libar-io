# Turbin3 Builders Cohort Q1 2025 by Jan Jankowski

Welcome to my **Turbin3 Builders Cohort Q1 2025** repository! Here you will find all code written by me during this program.

This cohort focuses on the foundational knowledge and prectical skills needed to navigate the evolving landscape of decentralized applications in Solana.

## Directories Overview

### airdrop

The very first challenge recieved before joining the cohort.
The tasks consisted of:

- Creating a keypair in devnet.
- Funding it with some Solana.
- Making a transfer from the generated address to our devnet wallet submitted for the cohort.
- Writing helper conversion functions for addresses from base58 to byte array and back.
- Consuming an IDL.
- Making a transaction to a program on devnet based on the IDL.

This task was written in _typescript_

### airdrop-rust

The next step still in the prerequisites phase was to repeat the process from the first task in _rust_

### solana-starter

Our first module in the world of Solana programming.

- The goal of the first class was to initialize a spl token and mint it.
